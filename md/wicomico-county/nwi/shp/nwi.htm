<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and classification as developed by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. The classification system was adopted as a national classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5 minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and wetlands attributes.  Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors. Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily photointerpreted. Maps derived from color infrared photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this mapping.  Users should also consult other information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that may have been produced by state and local governments, and not rely solely on NWI maps. See section on &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Completeness_Report&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; for more information.

</dd>
<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

The data provide consultants, planners, and resource managers with information on wetland location and type. The data were collected to meet U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service's mandate to map the wetland and deepwater habitats of the United States. The purpose of this survey was not to map all wetlands and deepwater habitats of the United States, but rather to use aerial photointerpretation techniques to produce thematic maps that show, in most cases, the larger ones and types that can be identified by such techniques. The objective was to provide better geospatial information on wetlands than found on the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. It was not the intent of the NWI to produce maps that show exact wetland boundaries comparable to boundaries derived from ground surveys. Boundaries are therefore generalized in most cases. The quality of the wetland data is variable  See section on &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Completeness_Report&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; for more information.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

The data was originally obtained from NWI with the extents of USGS 7.5' quadrangle for all the counties in Maryland.  The quadrangles belonging to any given county were then merged together to form a county-wide extents file, and that is how the data is being distributed my Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR).

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy printouts and/or symbolized display of the digital wetlands data on an interactive computer graphic system. In addition, quality control verification software (USFWS-NWI) tests the attributes against a master set of valid wetland attributes.

<dt><em>Logical_Consistency_Report:</em>  
<dd>

Polygons intersecting the neatline are closed along the border. Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. Line segments are a set of sequentially numbered coordinate pairs. No duplicate features exist nor duplicate points in a data string. Intersecting lines are separated into individual line segments at the point of intersection. Point data are represented by two sets of coordinate pairs, each with the same coordinate values. All nodes are represented by a single coordinate pair which indicates the beginning or end of a line segment. The neatline is generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file. All data crossing the neatline are clipped to the neatline and data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Tests for logical consistency are performed by quality control verification software (USFWS-NWI).

<dt><em>Completeness_Report:</em>  
<dd>

NWI maps do not show all wetlands, but attempt to show most photointerpretable wetlands given considerations of map/photo scale and wetland delineation practices. A target mapping unit (tmu) is an estimate of the size class of the smallest group of wetlands that NWI attempts to map consistently; it is not the smallest wetland mapped. Recognize that some wetland types are conspicuous and readily mapped (e.g., marshes and ponds) and smaller ones may be mapped. Drier wetlands and forested wetlands (especially evergreen) are more difficult to photointerpret and larger ones may be missed. The tmu also varies with photo scale; in forested regions, the tmu may be 3-5 acres (1:80K photos), 1-3 acres (1:58K), or 1 acre (1:40K). NWI maps should show most wetlands larger than the tmu. In the treeless prairies, a 1/4 acre tmu is possible due to the openness of terrain and occurrence of wetlands in distinct depressions. Take notice of the photo scale/type used to make the maps (see legend) and realize that black and white photos tend to yield more conservative interpretations than color infrared film. Most farmed wetlands (e.g., mucklands) are usually not mapped, except for pothole-type wetlands, cranberry bogs, and diked former tidelands (Sacramento Valley). Partly drained wetlands are conservatively mapped due to photointerpretation limitations. No attempt was made to identify regulated wetlands from other wetlands. Recognize that maps produced through photointerpretation are not as accurate as one prepared from on-the-ground surveys, so NWI boundaries are generalized.

<dd>

NWI maps are compiled through manual photointerpretation of NHAP or NAPP aerial photography supplemented by Soil Surveys and field checking of wetland photo signatures. Delineated wetland boundaries are manually transferred from interpreted photos to USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and then manually labeled. Quality control steps occur throughout the photointerpretation, map compilation, and map reproduction processes. Digital wetlands data are either manually digitized or scanned from stable-base copies of the 1:24,000 scale wetlands overlays registered to the standard U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangles into topologically correct data files using Arc/Info software. Files contain ground planimetric coordinates and wetland attributes. The quadrangles were referenced to the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27) horizontal datum. The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning resolution of at least 0.001 inches; the resulting raster data were vectorized and then attributed on an interactive editing station. Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to capture the digital data at a resolution of at least 0.005 inches; attribution was performed as the data were digitized. The determination of scanning versus manual digitizing production method was based on feature density, source map quality, feature symbology, and availability of production systems. The data were checked for position by comparing plots of the digital data to the source material

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) has reprojected the National Wetlands
Inventory data as produced by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service,  the data producer and
custodian.  The data, currently,  is being distributed in Maryland State Plane 1983 datum with units in meters in ESRI's shape file format.
<P>
There are two files that make up the entire coverage for any given county - one each for linear and polygonal features.  XXNWIL.shp, XXNWIL.shx and XXNWIL.dbf are the three constituent files of the ESRI's shape file for linear elements of the NWI file. (XX is the two letter county abbreviated code). XXNWIP.shp, XXNWIP.shx and XXNWIP.dbf are the three constituent files of the ESRI's shape file for for the polygon element of the NWI file. (XX is the two letter county abbreviated code.) Refer to the 'Place Keyword' section for details of abbreviations.
<P>
{PLEASE NOTE THAT THE DATA WAS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED IN DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS AND UNITS OF MEASUREMENT. THIS IS FOR THE PREVIOUS RELEASES ONLY.  THE CURRENT DATA IS IN MD SP NAD 1983 METERS.  Previously it was in SP83f for Montgomery Co., SP83m for Baltimore City and SP27f for Baltimore County and rest of the State in ARC/INFO export format. The combination of datums and units was necessary to be compatible with various software platforms.  These changes were performed using PC ARC/INFO's v. 3.5 PROJECT command.  The distribution files were created using the EXPORT command and are
contained on an ISO 9660 compatible CD-ROM disc.  The following is a description of the file
naming convention FOR THE PREVIOUS RELEASES:
AANWIW7F.E00 (Anne Arundel County, National Wetlands Inventory Wetlands,
Maryland State Plane 1927, Feet),
MONWIW3F.E00  (Montgomery County, National Wetlands Inventory Wetlands,
Maryland State Plane 1983, Feet),
BCNWIW3M.E00  (Baltimore City, National Wetlands Inventory Wetlands,
Maryland State Plane 1983, Meters).}

Wetlands are lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water
table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this
classification wetlands must have one or more of the following attributes: 1) at least periodically, the land
supports predominantly hydrophytes; 2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; and 3) the substrate
is non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of
each year.

<P>
Here you can 'input' the wetland 'classification code' in question. The program used to run this is &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;atx.exe&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;.  The result of your inquiry would be whether the 'questionable classification' is from a valid NWI codeset.  You also have a choice of 'short', 'long' or 'none' for the description of a valid NWI code; this makes for a good reading and provides for the understanding of wetlands.  This also has a link for the 'code legend'. This 'lays' out a schematic of the hierarchial classification.

<dd>

The wetland classification system is hierarchical, with wetlands and deep water
habitats divided among five major systems at the broadest level.
The five systems include Marine (open ocean and associated
coastline), Estuarine (salt marshes and brackish tidal water),
Riverine (rivers, creeks, and streams), Lacustrine (lakes and deep
ponds), and Palustrine (shallow ponds, marshes, swamps, sloughs).
Systems are further subdivided into subsystems which reflect
hydrologic conditions.  Below the subsystem is the class which
describes the appearance of the wetland in terms of vegetation or
substrate.  Each class is further subdivided into subclasses;
vegetated subclasses are described in terms of life form and
substrate subclasses in terms of composition.  The classification
system also includes modifiers to describe hydrology (water
regime), soils, water chemistry (pH, salinity), and special
modifiers relating to man's activities (e.g., impounded, partly
drained).
