1.2 Description
1.2.1 Abstract: This is a data table, in comma-delimited, ASCII format, which contains
information about selected physical properties, particularly grain size, of 4,255 surficial sediment
samples from the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.  Samples were collected on a 1-km grid by the
Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) between June 1976 and August 1984.
1.2.2 Purpose: One component of the Chesapeake Bay Earth Science Study (CBESS) was a
baseline inventory of Chesapeake Bay bottom sediments, more particularly of those properties or
features (e.g. sediment type, water content, sulfur content, carbon content, rate of sediment
accumulation or erosion) that affect the distribution of toxic substances.  The project, funded by
the Environmental Protection Agency (Contract No. EPA R805965), was a cooperative effort
between the states of Maryland and Virginia.  The Maryland Geological Survey and the Virginia
Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) were responsible for sampling and analyzing sediments
deposited in the waters of their respective states.  Information contained in this data set is for
Maryland only.

2 Data Quality Information
2.1 Attribute Accuracy
2.1.1 Attribute Accuracy Report
This section of the metadata summarizes information found in an appendix to the report by
Kerhin
and others (1988) cited in Section 1.2.3 Supplemental Information.  It will be easier to
understand
this section if you first read Section 2.5 Lineage.
Quality assurance for grain-size analysis involved three major components: (1) calibration of the
individual analytical instruments, (2) inter-calibration of specially designed instruments with
similar devices at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences (VIMS), and (3) duplicate analyses at
MGS and VIMS of sediments collected in both Maryland and Virginia waters.
Instrument Calibration
Calibration of the rapid sediment analyzer (RSA) was accomplished through the use of glass
beads of known size, sphericity and density.  Calibration of the Coulter Counter was
accomplished through procedures recommended in the manufacturer's operating manual.
At the time of the CBESS study, most previous sedimentological studies had used pipetting
techniques, rather than a Coulter Counter, to determine the size distribution of fine-grained
sediments.  Therefore, for three sediment samples, MGS compared results obtained by the two
methods.  For all three samples, the grain-size distribution resulting from Coulter Counter
analysis
was somewhat finer than that determined by pipette analysis.  The difference in the mean grain
size calculated by each technique ranged from a low of 0.07 phi for one sample to a high of 0.29
phi for another.  For each sample, the envelope enclosing the Coulter Counter data was smaller
than that for the pipette data, indicating the superior precision of the Coulter Counter technique.
Two possible explanations were offered to account for the difference in results obtained by the
two techniques:  (1) particle density or shape effects, and (2) an instrument "noise" effect.  The
second effect probably contributed more to the observed differences; Coulter Counter operators
noticed that machine noise tended to accumulate in the output channels representing the finer end
of the size distribution.  In any case, the differences between the two techniques were quite small.
The greater precision of the Coulter Counter, coupled with its ease of operation, recommended
its
use.
Inter-Laboratory Calibration
Both MGS and VIMS processed 20 sediment samples, representative of a broad range of
sediment types, to compare results from the two laboratories.  Eight samples were collected from
the Bay in Virginia, and 12 from Maryland.  Each of the paired samples matched on Shepard's
class.  For 14 of the samples, both institutions were able to determine mean grain size.  The
analytical results were compared statistically, using a t-test for dependent samples.  At the 5%
level of significance, there were no differences between the results obtained by MGS and VIMS.
2.2 Logical Consistency Report
Data were checked for permissible values.  For most of the parameters measured, "-999"
indicates
a missing value.
2.3 Completeness Report
Omissions
The main trunk of the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay was sampled, as well as Eastern
Bay, the Choptank River, and Tangier Sound.  Within the study area, no samples were collected
in the vicinity of  Aberdeen Proving Ground or Bloodsworth Island because of the risk of
retrieving unexploded ordnance.
Selection criteria 
Total carbon, organic carbon, and total sulfur determinations were made for about 25% of the
samples collected.  Initially, every mid-bay and certain nearshore samples were analyzed,
providing coverage on a 1-km grid.  Sampling density was reduced when it became apparent that
carbon and sulfur analyses could not keep pace with other phases of the project.  Results from the
early analyses showed that in 85% of the sandy samples, carbon and sulfur were below detection. 
Based on those findings, sandy samples - usually nearshore samples characterized by low water
content - were excluded from analysis.  Later in the project, every fourth mid-bay sample was
analyzed, provided that its water content exceeded 25% by weight.  If water content fell below
that limit, the sample was generally replaced by a neighboring one.
2.4 Positional Accuracy
2.4.1 Horizontal Positional Accuracy
2.4.1.1 Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report
As described in Section 2.5.2.1 Process Description: Sample collection, surficial samples were
collected according to two different protocols, "nearshore" or "mid-bay".  Accuracy of nearshore
sample location was estimated to be ñ 30 m.  Teledyne-Hastings, the manufacturer of the Raydist
radionavigational system used to locate mid-bay samples, reported the positional accuracy of the
system as  ñ 0.5 m.  To ensure accuracy, the crew checked calibrations at least twice during each
sampling day.  Based on these checks, operational accuracy was about ñ 1.5 m.  However, due to
such factors as vessel orientation, wind, and tidal currents, mid-bay sampling accuracy was
estimated to be ñ 10 m.

2.5 Lineage
2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1 Process Description: Sample collection
Surficial samples, taken from the top 5 cm of the sediment column, were collected according to
one of two different protocols.  Water depth dictated which protocol, "nearshore" or "mid-bay," 
was used.
Nearshore samples were collected in waters less than 3 m deep from a shallow draft, 17-ft Boston
Whaler.  Samples were taken along shore-perpendicular transects located approximately 1 km
apart.  The azimuth-range method, with a shore-based compass and transit or theodolite, was
used for navigation.  Along a predetermined azimuth, a time-calibrated transect was made at a
specific boat speed out to the limiting depth of 3 m.  Bottom samples were then collected at
specific time-interval markers with a Dietz-Lafond sampler and packaged in labeled Whirl-Pak 
bags.
Mid-bay sampling, in waters deeper than 3 m, took place aboard several larger, deeper draft
vessels.  Sampling sites were located with a Teledyne-Hastings Raydist radionavigational
system. 
Initially, boat crews followed curved Raydist "lanes," located 1 km apart, and collected samples
at
1 km intervals along those lanes.  This sampling plan accounts for the arcuate pattern of samples
located between the Bay Bridge and Holland Point.  Later, sampling sites were located on an
orthogonal, 1-km grid developed from a generation point (76o 38' 00" W and 38o 00' 00" N) and
based on a Universal Transverse Mercator projection.  Locations, specified initially as latitude
and
longitude (NAD27), were converted to Raydist Red and Green coordinates.  The boat captain
occupied the target locations, and the crew recorded actual Raydist values at the time of sample
collection.  Actual Raydist coordinates were subsequently converted back to the geographic
coordinates (NAD27) stored in the data table.
At each mid-bay station, two samples were collected with a Van Veen or a Petersen grab
sampler. 
One sample, later analyzed for grain size composition, was packaged in a labeled Whirl-Pak 
bag. 
The other sample, for water, bulk density, carbon, and sulfur determinations, was placed in a
labeled, 30-dram, opaque plastic vial and refrigerated.
2.5.2.3 Process Date: Date of sample collection, reported for each sample in the data set
2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1  Process Description: Water content
The procedure for measuring water content consisted of weighing a 25-50 g split of the
homogenized sample, drying the split at 65 degrees C, and reweighing it.  Water content, in
percent, was calculated as:
water content (%) = [water weight (g) / wet weight of sediment (g)] * 100,
where water weight is the difference between the wet and dry weights of the sample.
The procedure is based on the assumption that the sediment is saturated with free water (water
that is not bound up in the crystalline lattice of clay minerals).
2.5.2.3 Process Date: Unknown
2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1  Process Description: Bulk density
Bulk density, in g/cubic cm, was calculated from the weights used in determining water content,
as:
bulk density (g/cubic cm) = wet weight of sediment (g) /[(dry weight of sediment (g) / 2.72
(g/cubic cm)) + water weight (g)].
The calculation is based on the assumption that the average grain density of the particulate matter
is 2.72 g/cubic cm and that all voids in the sediment are completely saturated with water.
2.5.2.3 Process Date: Unknown
2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1 Process Description: Grain size analysis
Overview
The grain size composition of each sample was determined for sand-, silt-, and clay-sized
particles, ranging in diameter from 0.00006 to 2 mm.  Particle size, expressed as cumulative
weight percent, was measured on a logarithmic scale and grouped into dimensionless phi
intervals:
phi = -log2 d
where d equals particle diameter in mm.
The grain size distribution between -1 and 10 phi was determined analytically, then extended to
14
phi by arithmetically extrapolating from the cumulative percent at 10 phi to 100% at 14 phi.  No
single analytical technique can effectively measure this range of particle sizes, so the results of
several procedures were combined.  Prior to analysis, all samples were treated with mild
chemical
agents to remove carbonate and organic material and to disaggregate and disperse the particles. 
The sample was split by sieving into a sand (coarser than 4 phi) and a silt/clay (finer than 4 phi)
fraction.  The distribution of the sand fraction, in 1/4 phi intervals, was determined using a rapid
sediment analyzer (RSA), a settling tube that measures particle size based on settling velocity. 
The silts and clays were pipetted, and the size distribution between 4 phi and 10 phi was
analyzed
by Coulter Counter, an electronic analyzer that measures particle size based on volume.  Those
results were grouped into 1/3 phi intervals.  The data so generated were computer-merged to
yield a cumulative grain size distribution for each sample.  Summary statistics describing the
grain
size distribution were derived from the cumulative weight percent values, including sediment
type
(Shepard's class) and various graphic and moment measures of mean, sorting, skewness, and
kurtosis.
Sample Preparation
Sample preparation, the first step in grain size analysis, entailed rinsing away soluble salts,
removing carbonate and organic material, and disaggregating and dispersing the fine particles. 
Samples were treated chemically to separate aggregates into individual grains and to prevent
particles from coagulating during subsequent stages of the analysis.  Approximately 50 g of the
wet, homogenized sample were placed in a 400-ml beaker.  100 ml of 10% hydrochloric acid
(HCl) were added to digest carbonate material, primarily shells.  After soaking overnight in HCl,
the sample was rinsed with deionized water and decanted.  Rinsing and decanting were repeated
until the supernatant was colorless.
Following carbonate removal, the sample was treated with hydrogen peroxide to digest
organic material and disaggregate sediment particles.  The previously determined water content
of
the sample dictated the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used.  Water content is an indirect
indicator of average grain size.  Coarse (i.e., sandy) sediments invariably contain less water than
finer (i.e., muddier) ones.  Typically, coarse sediments also contain less organic matter.  A
weaker
solution - 60 ml of 6% hydrogen peroxide - was added to samples containing less than 25%
water; samples consisting of more than 25% water were treated with 100 ml of 15% hydrogen
peroxide.  The sample was placed in a cold water bath to control the vigor of the exothermic
reaction and left overnight.  The next day, the sample was heated to 90-100 degreees C to
dissociate any remaining peroxide.  Again, the sample was rinsed with deionized water until the
supernatant was colorless.
If, in the lab technician's estimation, the silt plus clay portion of the sample exceeded 5%, the
sample was treated with a 0.26% solution of sodium metaphosphate to disperse individual grains. 
After soaking 24 hours in 250 ml of the dispersant, the sample was agitated ultrasonically for two
minutes using a Bronwill Biosonik IV probe equipped with a high power tip set at 50% intensity. 
This step was omitted if the silt plus clay fraction of the sample was judged to be less than 5%.
Sieving
The sand-sized sediment was separated from the finer fraction by wet sieving with a 4 phi (0.062
mm) mesh screen.  Samples consisting of more than 95% sand were washed with deionized
water. 
Both the portion retained on the sieve (sand) and the pan fraction (silt plus clay) were dried, then
weighed.  The sand fraction was sieved again to remove any particles coarser than -1 phi (2.00
mm), then routed to the RSA.  The silt plus clay component was not analyzed further.
If the sample contained less than 95% sand (i.e., the silt plus clay fraction constituted more than
5% of the sample), the finer particles were washed through the sieve using the dispersant, sodium
metaphosphate.  The silt plus clay suspension, which passed through the sieve, was poured into a
1000-ml graduated cylinder.  Adding more dispersant raised the volume of the liquid in the
cylinder to one liter.  This fraction of the sample was pipetted, then analyzed with the Coulter
Counter.  The sand fraction was washed with deionized water to remove the dispersant, dried,
and weighed.  If it represented more than 5% of the sample, by weight, it was sieved again to
remove gravel-sized grains and analyzed with the RSA.
Pipetting
The 1000-ml silt/clay suspension was stirred to distribute particles uniformly throughout the
cylinder, and three 20-ml withdrawals were made.  The first two aliquots were withdrawn 20
seconds after the sample was stirred, at a depth of 20 cm, before any particular size fraction had
completely settled past the sampling point.  These "4 phi" withdrawals contained particles 62æ in
diameter and smaller and represented the entire silt plus clay spectrum.  One of the 4 phi
withdrawals was deposited in a 15-dram vial and dispatched to the Coulter Counter for a detailed
analysis of the silt plus clay fraction.  The other was deposited in an evaporating dish, dried, and
used to calculate the total amount of silt and clay in the cylinder.  The third or "10 phi" aliquot
was taken about 24 hours after the second, at a depth of 7-10 cm.  Exact time and depth
depended on the temperature of the suspension, as required by Stoke's law.  By this time, all
particles larger than 10 phi had settled below the depth of withdrawal; this aliquot contained only
particles smaller than 10 phi in size.  It also was dried in an evaporating dish and later used to
extrapolate that part of the grain size distribution between 10 phi and 14 phi.
Coulter Counter Analysis
In lieu of pipetting, an electronic analyzer - the Coulter Counter TA II - provided a detailed
breakdown of particle sizes between 4 phi and 10 phi, in 1/3 phi increments.  Briefly, the Coulter
Counter operates as follows.  Particles suspended in a weak electrolyte within an electrical field
are volumetrically sized and counted by measuring particle-induced voltage pulses.  The
magnitude of a pulse is proportional to a particle's volume, and the number of pulses is a measure
of particle concentration.  
Two aperture tubes, each capable of measuring a particle size range from 2-40% of the aperture
diameter, were required to measure the 4 phi to 10 phi range.  The 30æ and 140æ apertures were
chosen because of overlap in their size ranges.  The Coulter Counter was calibrated according to
the manufacture's specifications, except that the 16 channel edges were set to correspond to 1/3
phi units rather than to the spherical diameters suggested in the instruction manual (Coulter
Electronics, Inc., 1975).  This facilitated data manipulation and eliminated overlaps or gaps
between pipette and Coulter Counter results.
Prior to analysis, the sample - a "4 phi" pipette withdrawal - was resuspended by placing the
sample vial in a sonic bath for 20 minutes.  The sample was first analyzed using the 140æ
aperture.  Several drops of the sample were introduced into a beaker containing the commercially
available electrolyte Isoton II, bringing the concentration index up to the level (4-5%)
recommended for minimum coincidence counting.  Stirring speed was adjusted to 500-600 rps
using a hand-held tachometer.  Particles were counted, following the procedure outlined in the
instruction manual, until a standard total particle volume had accumulated.  The sample and
electrolyte were then sieved through a 20æ mesh, and the analysis was repeated using the 30æ
tube.  Sample analysis was completed within two hours of the sonic treatment to minimize
measuring the effects of flocculation of the particles suspended in the electrolyte.
Rapid Sediment Analysis
The sand component of the sample was analyzed with a rapid sediment analyzer (RSA).  The
RSA
is a settling tube operating on the principle of settling velocity, insofar as larger particles fall
faster
than smaller ones.  Stoke's law, however, is invalid for particle sizes coarser than 4 phi due to the
turbulence that develops in a particle's wake as it descends through a column of water.  Instead,
velocities for sand-sized spheres have been determined from direct observations of falling
particles, and empirical equations have been developed to predict fall velocities for different
particle sizes and water temperatures.
The RSA developed by MGS is based on a microbalance system designed by R.J. Gibbs (1974)
and modified by the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers.  The Survey has further refined the CERC system: large scale oscillations due to
coarse sediment striking the balance pan have been reduced; undesirable vibration noise has been
decreased; accurate timing of sample introduction has been achieved; and the devise has been
interfaced with a programmable calculator, permitting fast, accurate data reduction and
calculation of statistical parameters.
The RSA was calibrated with glass beads of known size, density, and sphericity.  The accuracy
of
the instrument was tested by inter-calibration with one of similar design.  Both yielded similar
values for the particle size distribution of sediments.  Design, operation, and calibration of the
RSA are described more fully by Halka and others (1980).
The apparatus consists of (1) a vertical plexiglass tube - 175 cm long and 15 cm in diameter, (2)
a
sediment injection system directly above the tube, and (3) a circular plexiglass weighing pan
suspended 150 cm below the water surface on a fine wire attached to an electrobalance.  The
injector and the electrobalance are interfaced with the calculator.
The first step in operating the RSA was checking and recording the temperature of the water
column.  A maximum difference between top and bottom temperatures of 1 degree C was
permitted.  A larger differential produces convection currents, which interfere with particle
settling.  Actual temperatures in the RSA ranged from 19-23 degrees C and remained constant
over the average working period.  The recorded temperature was entered into the data reduction
program to compensate for viscosity and density changes in the water column due to temperature
variations.
The RSA sampling and statistical analysis programs were loaded into the calculator, then
activated.  The electrobalance and strip chart recorder were zeroed.  A microsplitter was used to
obtain a 0.4-0.6 g aliquot of the sand fraction.  The grains were sprinkled evenly over the face of
the sample introduction plate, which had been previously wetted with a solution of Kodak
Photoflow (1 ppt).  This solution causes the sample to adhere to the plate when it is inverted and
placed in the injector.  It also breaks the surface tension of the water when the sample makes
contact.  After insertion into the injection assembly, the introduction plate was gently lowered to
the water surface, simultaneously releasing the sand grains and activating the calculator.
The calculator immediately began recording the weight of the sediment accumulating on the
weighing pan, taking a reading every 0.2675 seconds.  Because the time interval between
successive readings was known, the cumulative weight of the sediment through time could be
determined.  The standardized fall time for each 1/4 phi class in the sand-sized range was
calculated, and the cumulative weight at that time was computed.  These values were stored on a
computer tape indexed by sample location coordinates.  The tape served as input for additional
statistical manipulations and as a permanent record of each sample's grain size distribution.
The amount of time required to complete an analysis varied, depending on the grain size
distribution of the sand; finer samples took longer to settle than coarser ones.  Maximum run
time
per sample was 8.5 minutes for settling and 4 minutes for data processing.
Merging the Data
Data generated by sieving, by pipetting, by the Coulter Counter, and by the RSA were
computer-merged to yield a cumulative grain size distribution for each sample.  The cumulative
weight percentages for each of the 1/4 phi intervals comprising the sand component were
converted to fractions of the total sample as follows:
(1/4 phi interval weight / final RSA weight) * (sand weight / total sample weight) * 100
Gravel, that fraction coarser than -1 phi, was excluded from the grain size distribution unless it
constituted more than 5% of the total sample weight.
The differential volume percentages generated by the two-tube Coulter Counter analysis were
combined to yield cumulative values normalized to 100%, according to the volume percent
method outline by Coulter Electronics.  By multiplying the Coulter Counter results by:
(4 phi weight - 10 phi weight) / total weight,
each phi interval was adjusted so that it represented a fraction of the entire sample, not just that
portion of the sample between 4 phi and 10 phi.
The distribution of the material finer than 10 phi was estimated by arithmetically extrapolating
from the cumulative percent at 10 phi, to 100% at 14 phi.  The extrapolation was based on two
assumptions - that all sediment was coarser than 14 phi and that the median of the fraction
between 10 phi and 14 phi occurred at 12 phi.
Statistics summarizing the grain size distributions - graphic and moment measures, Shepard's
class, and percent sand/silt/clay - were derived from the cumulative distributions obtained by
computer merging of the data.  The equations used to calculate the summary statistics are
described in Section 5.1.2 Attribute Information.

2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1 Process Description: Carbon analysis
Total and organic carbon content was determined for about 25% of all mid-bay samples.  Sample
coverage for carbon analysis varied.  Initially, every mid-bay and certain nearshore samples were
analyzed, providing coverage on a 1-km grid.  Sampling density was reduced when it became
apparent that carbon analysis could not keep pace with other phases of the project.  Results from
the early analyses showed that in 85% of the sandy samples, carbon was below detection.  Based
on those findings, sandy samples - usually nearshore samples characterized by low water content
-
were excluded from analysis.  Later in the project, every fourth mid-bay sample was analyzed,
provided that its water content exceeded 25% by weight.  If water content fell below that limit,
the sample was usually replaced by a neighboring one.
Samples selected for carbon analysis were oven-dried and mechanically powdered in a ball mill
to
ensure their homogeneity.  Two splits were taken from the powdered sample.  One was analyzed
directly for total carbon content.  The other was treated with 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) to
remove inorganic carbon (i.e., calcium carbonate from shell fragments), redried, reground by
hand, and analyzed for organic carbon content.
Carbon was measured using a LECO gasometric analyzer (Model 572-100) in conjunction with a
LECO induction furnace (Model 521-100).  Technicians followed operating procedures
recommended by LECO.  Approximately 0.1 g of dried sample plus one charge each of iron and
copper accelerator were used per analysis.  Barium carbonate standards were run after every
10-12 sediment analyses to check machine calibration.  Each carbon determination was based on
at least two runs.   Results of duplicate analyses were averaged.  Carbon values are judged to be
accurate to within ñ0.10 weight percent, except in a few cases, usually with low carbon values, in
which split problems persisted despite multiple analyses.

2.5.2 Process Step
2.5.2.1 Process Description: Sulfur analysis
Percent sulfur, by weight, was determined for each of the samples selected for carbon analysis. 
Duplicate 0.1 g samples were analyzed on a LECO automatic sulfur titrator (Model 532-000)
operated in conjunction with a LECO induction furnace (Model 521-100).  Only sulfur species
converted to sulfur dioxide during combustion were measured by this process.
Again, technicians followed operating procedures recommended by LECO, with the following
modifications.  Portland cement (NBS standard reference material #636), containing 0.92%
sulfur, was used in machine calibration.  One scoop (0.3 ml) each of tin chips and low-sulfur iron
powder were added to a sample to accelerate combustion.  Samples were burned for 10 minutes. 
Sodium azide (5.0 g/l) was added to the 1% HCl solution to block interference by nitrogen.
If the percent difference between the two runs exceeded 5%, a third split was processed, and the
results of the three runs were averaged.  Otherwise, the duplicate runs were averaged.  Percent
difference was calculated as follows:
percent difference = [((S1 - S2) / 2) / S] * 100
where S1 and S2 are the percent sulfur values obtained from the first two runs, and S is their
average.

measures the degree of asymmetry of a distribution, as well as the sign (i.e., whether a curve has
an asymmetrical tail on the left or right; for symmetrical curves, skewness = 0.0; for curves with
excess fine material (a tail to the right), skewness is positive (+); for curves with excess coarse
material (a tail to the left), skewness is negative (-); the more the skewness value departs from
0.0, the greater the degree of asymmetry

5.2 Overview Description
5.2.1 Entity and Attribute Overview: The data set contains information about selected physical
properties of 4,255 samples collected from the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.  Aside from water,
bulk density, carbon, and sulfur content, most of the parameters have to do with grain size
composition, in particular the cumulative phi intervals comprising the size range between
0.00006-2.00 mm (14 phi to -1 phi).
